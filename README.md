A C++ library implementing `value_ptr` - a smart-pointer with value-semantics.

Value types are simple and intuitive. Unfortunately sometimes an implementation detail requires us to use pointers.

The standard library demonstrates how handy smart-pointers can be for encoding ownership and lifetime semantics, but none of the smart-pointers implement value-semantics.

This is why `valuable::value_ptr` was made.

## Example

```c++
#include <string>
#include <valuable/value_ptr.hpp>

using namespace std;
using namespace valuable;

struct Tree {
  string const name;
  value_ptr<Tree> left;
  value_ptr<Tree> right;

  Tree(
    string const& name,
    value_ptr<Tree> const& left = value_ptr<Tree>{},
    value_ptr<Tree> const& right = value_ptr<Tree>{})
    : name{name}
    , left{left}
    , right{right}
  {}
};


int main() {
  Tree root = Tree{
    "root",
      Tree{"l"}
      Tree{"r"}
  };

  root.left = root; // copy of root assigned to left
  root.right = root; // and we don't have cyclic references
}

```

# Installation

This library requires a C++ 14 compiler.

## Buckaroo

Install with [Buckaroo](https://buckaroo.pm):

```
buckaroo add github.com/LoopPerfect/valuable
```

The [Buck](https://buckbuild.com/) target is `:valuable`

## Manual

Alternatively, you can copy & paste the headers into your include path:

```
cp valuable/include/*.hpp $InstallPath/include/valuable
```

## QtCreator

You can also use Qt Creator for development. There's no need to build Google Test as it is built along with the test project. In the Build Steps, add the Google Test Git checkout path to the additional qmake arguments:

```
GOOGLETEST_PATH=d:/path/to/googletest
```
